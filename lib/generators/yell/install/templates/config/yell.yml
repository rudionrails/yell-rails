# The following is an example config file for yell with all possible options available.
#
# To learn about the possible configuration options via a YAML file, read the wiki 
# on github: https://github.com/rudionrails/yell/wiki/101-configuration-with-yaml

development: &development
  # Enable colorized log output with the following. It is handy for development
  # or testing, but should not be turned on for staging or production. Otherwise 
  # you will see those annoying ANSI color codes when on the remote production 
  # machine.
  :colors: true

# we use the same settings for test that we defined for development
test: *development

# In production, you should configure yell somewhat more specific. The following 
# is an example config - change it at your own will.
production:
  # Set the minimum (global) log level for Yell. If you prefer a different setup 
  # you may comine various log levels, like:
  #   # this will only log between :info and :fatal level
  #   :level: 'gte.info lte.fatal'
  :level: 'gte.info'

  # Keep a max of 7 files for every adapter per default. You can remove this option 
  # if you wish to keep all files, otherwise, Yell will cleanup any :datefile 
  # after a rollover of 7 times.
  :keep: 7

  # define multiple adapters: one for notice and one for error messages
  :adapters:
    # this adapter writes all messages with a log level of warn or lower
    # and writes to production.log (because this is your Rails.env)
    - :datefile:
        :level: 'lte.warn'

    # this adapter writes all messages with a log level of error or higher
    # and writes to error.log
    - :datefile:
        :level: 'gte.error'
        :filename: 'log/error.log'
